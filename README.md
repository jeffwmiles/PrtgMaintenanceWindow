# PrtgMaintenanceWindow
Website to add PRTG maintenance window for specified set of objects

Blog post detailing it here: https://faultbucket.ca/2019/01/prtg-api-to-add-maintenance-window/

Many potential improvements are possible here:
- Find objects to add maintenance window dynamically through API based on Tag
- Figure out a better method of setting a schedule on the required objects programmatically, so that the maintenance window is effective
